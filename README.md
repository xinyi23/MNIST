# MNIST
This is a classic feedforward algorithm for MNIST handwritten digit recognition.

Create a terminal. Get in the root file.
You can train your model by running train.py.
You can also get the result from the model that already trained in this file by running test.py.

The show.py has no relationship with model training. It shows the picture in MNIST dataset.
